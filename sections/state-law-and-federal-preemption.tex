\subsection{The Tort of Misappropriation}

\subsubsection{Quasi-Property: \emph{International News Service v. Associated 
Press}}

News stories can be protect as a form of ``quasi-property'' which can be 
protected against misappropriation by direct competitors.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item INS and AP competed to deliver ``hot news'' to newspapers across the 
    country. INS began copying AP's stories and sending them to newspapers 
    itself---for instance, by copying stores published on the East Coast and 
    sending them to West Coast newspapers.\footnote{Casebook p. 1006--07.}
    \item Can AP win an injunction?
    \item Justice Pitney:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item INS argued that AP did not have a property right in its 
        published stories.
        \item News articles are copyrightable, but the underlying facts, apart 
        from their expression, are not.\footnote{Casebook p. 1008.}
        \item The case depends on whether INS's actions counted as unfair 
        competition.
        \item Since news has value in the context of the competition between 
        INS and AP, courts can consider to be a form of 
        ``quasi-property.''\footnote{Casebook p. 1009.} Misappropriation of 
        this form of property is actionable.
        \item Affirmed (held for AP).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Justice Holmes, concurring:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This is the same harm as misrepresentation (i.e., passing off 
        your goods using another's name).\footnote{Casebook p. 1012--13.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Justice Brandeis, dissenting:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item AP has no property right in its published stories. Failure to 
        give credit is not fraud.\footnote{Casebook p. 1014.}
        \item INS's conduct was unfair, but it's not the court's rule to 
        create a new, complex property right.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
