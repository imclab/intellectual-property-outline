See supplement p. 248.

\subsubsection{History}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Venice in the fifteenth century recognized exclusive rights in the 
    printing of particular books (as opposed to the technology of creating the 
    books).\footnote{Casebook p. 430.}
    \item \textbf{Statute of Anne} (1710): authors gain exclusive rights for 
    14 years, renewable for another 14 years, subject to registration, notice, 
    and deposit. The government could also set maximum 
    prices.\footnote{Casebook p. 431.}
    \item The continental approach emphasized moral rights, as opposed to the 
    English system of property rights.
    \item The original Copyright Act (1790) mirrored the Statute of Anne. By 
    the end of the nineteenth century, it had been amended to include a range 
    of new technologies (e.g., photography).\footnote{Casebook p. 432.}
    \item \textbf{1909 Act}: extended protection to ``all writings''; extended 
    term to 28 years plus a 28 year renewal.
    \item \textbf{1976 Act}: extended protection to anything ``fixed in a 
    tangible medium of expression''; extended term to life of the author plus 
    50 years; loosened notice and registration requirements; established 
    compulsory licensing regimes; and codified exceptions, including fair use. 
    The 1998 Act extended the term to life of the author plus seventy 
    years.\footnote{Casebook p. 433.}
    \item 1989: the United States joined the Berne convention, scaling back 
    formalities and restoring copyright for foreign works still under 
    protection in the source country.
    \item \textbf{DMCA} (1998): anticircumvention provisions and liability 
    protections for service providers for infringing acts of their 
    subscribers.\footnote{Casebook pp. 433--34.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Overview}

\paragraph{Elements of a Protectable Copyright}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Copyrightable subject matter}: any literary or artistic 
    expression (but not the idea itself).
    \item \textbf{Threshold for protection}: must (1) have a ``modicum of 
    originality'' and (2) be fixed in a ``tangible medium of expression.''
    \item \textbf{Formalities}: notice is required for works published before 
    1989. Registration is required to sue for infringement. Deposit is 
    required for registration.
    \item \textbf{Authorship and ownership}: only the creator, transferee, or 
    employer can bring an infringement suit.
    \item \textbf{Duration of copyright}: life plus 70 years; or 95 years from 
    the publication of anonymous, pseudonymous, or for-hire works; or 120 
    years from the year of creation, whichever comes first.
    \item The Copyright Office does not assess validity (other than requiring 
    a modicum of creativity) or prior art.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item TODO: does the copyright office ever reject applications?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A copyright is protectable at the moment of 
    creation.\footnote{Casebook p. 434.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Ownership Rights}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Reproduction}: owner has the exclusive right to make copies. 
    She can sue for ``material'' and ``substantial'' copying.
    \item \textbf{Derivative works}: original owner has the exclusive right to 
    prepare derivative works (e.g., translations).
    \item \textbf{Distribution}: the owner controls sale and distribution, but 
    only for the first sale.
    \item \textbf{Performance and display}: owner has the right to control.
    \item \textbf{Anticircumvention}: prohibitions on bypassing technological 
    protections.
    \item \textbf{Moral rights}: visual artists have an attribution right and 
    a right to prevent ``intentional distortion, mutilation, or other 
    modification~.~.~.~''\footnote{Casebook p. 435.}
    \item Limitations: fair use, compulsory licensing.
    \item Copyright vs. patent: copyright holders can prevent copying and 
    certain uses (e.g., public performance), but they cannot prevent others 
    from making, using, or selling their creations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Philosophy}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Personhood, natural law.
    \item Predominant in the United States: utilitarian. The primary goal is 
    to enhance the public interest. The secondary goal is to reward 
    authors.\footnote{Casebook p. 436.}
    \item There is an increasing recognition of moral rights in the United 
    States.\footnote{Casebook p. 437.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements}

\subsubsection{Original Works of Authorship}

\paragraph{17 U.S.C. \S\ 102: Subject Matter of Copyright: In General}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Original.
    \item ``~.~.~.~fixed in any tangible medium of expression~.~.~.~''
    \item A work gains copyright protection if it was independently created, 
    even if it's identical---see Learned Hand on Keats.\footnote{Casebook p. 
    439.} The originality requirement is very low; exceptions are slogans, 
    familiar symbols, etc.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{No Copyright for Facts: \emph{Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone 
Services}}
~\\\\Copyright requires originality. Facts and unoriginal creations cannot be 
copyrighted.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Feist copied records from Rural's phonebook for its own phonebook. 
    Rural sued for infringement.
    \item Justice O'Connor:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Facts are not copyrightable. But compilations of facts generally 
        are.\footnote{Casebook p. 441.}
        \item Originality is ``the touchstone of copyright 
        protection'' because it is constitutionally and statutorily 
        mandated.\footnote{Casebook p. 443.}Originality requires (1) 
        independent creation and (2) a minimal degree of creativity.  
        Facts are not original. Therefore, facts are not copyrightable.
        \item Copyright of an entire work does not imply copyright of each 
        element.\footnote{Casebook p. 443.}
        \item ``Not all copying, however, is copyright 
        infringement.''\footnote{Casebook p. 443.} Infringement requires 
        copying of elements that are original. 
        \item Rural's alphabetical arrangement ``is not only unoriginal, it is 
        practically inevitable.''\footnote{Casebook p. 445.} Since Rural's 
        arrangement was unoriginal, it was not copyrightable. Therefore, 
        Feist's copying was non-infringing.
