\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{History}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Acto servi corrupti: corrupting a slave, i.e., bribing to get secret 
    information.\footnote{Casebook p. 33.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Traditionally a common law tort.\footnote{Casebook p. 35.}
    \item 1979: Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), adopted by 44 states and 
    DC.\footnote{Casebook p. 36.}
    \item Structure of a trade secret claim:\footnote{Casebook p. 37.
    }
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Subject matter.
        \item Reasonable precautions to keep it secret.
        \item Misappropriation.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Theory}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Utilitarian: protecting secrets against theft encourages investment 
    in proprietary information.\footnote{Casebook p. 37.}
    \item Tort theory: prevent and punish wrongful acts---``the maintenance of 
    commercial morality.''\footnote{Casebook p.  37--38.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Subject Matter}

\subsubsection{Defining Trade Secrets: \emph{Metallurgical Industries, Inc. v. 
Fourtek, Inc.}}

To determine whether information is a trade secret, courts should consider the 
level of confidentiality, the value to the secret holder, and the cost of 
developing the secret.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Metallurgical developed improvements to the zinc recovery process. 
    It alleged that these improvements were trade secrets and that former 
    employees stole them and brought them to Fourtek.\footnote{Casebook p. 40.}
    \item The district court held that the modification process was not 
    protectable as a trade secret.
    \item What is a trade secret?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Metallurgical's improvements were unknown to the industry. It 
        took steps to protect this information (e.g., NDAs), suggesting it was 
        secret.\footnote{Casebook p. 41.}
        \item Courts should \emph{consider} these factors, but they are not 
        \emph{required}:\footnote{Casebook p. 41--42.}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Confidentiality.
            \item Value to the secret holder.
            \item Cost of developing the secret.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Here, Metallurgical had a trade secret.
\end{enumerate}
