\section{Overview}

\subsection{Patent}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Elements of patentability}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Subject matter} (35 U.S.C. \S\ 101).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Patentable: process, machine, manufacture, composition of 
            matter. \emph{Chakrabarty}.
            \item Not patentable: laws of nature, physical phenomena, abstract 
            ideas. \emph{Bilski}.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Utility} (35 U.S.C. \S\ 101).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Not patentable: compounds without known uses.  Courts don't 
            want to grant ``hunting licenses.'' \emph{Brenner}.  \item 
            Patentable: promising clinical results in mice. 
            \emph{Brana}.
            \item Deceptive inventions are patentable. \emph{Juicy Whip}. But 
            malicious inventions may not be.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Written description and enablement} (35 U.S.C. \S\ 112).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Must contain a \textbf{written description} that can 
            \textbf{``enable any person skilled in the art''} to make it.
            \item You can't claim more than you enable. \emph{Incandescent 
            Lamp}.
            \item Claims are limited to their written descriptions. 
            \emph{Gentry Gallery}. Applicants must disclose actual structures 
            and actual working examples. \emph{Ariad}.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Novelty} (35 U.S.C. \S\ 102).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Novelty: inventor vs. prior art. Is it new?
            \item Priority: inventor vs. inventor. Who invented it first?
            \item 1952 Act: first to invent.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item ``~.~.~.~\textbf{priority} generally goes to the first 
                inventor to (1) reduce an invention to practice, without (2) 
                abandoning the invention.''\footnote{Casebook p. 248.}
                \item You don't get priority if you unreasonably delayed 
                reduction to practice. \emph{Griffith}.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item AIA (for patents filed on or after March 16, 2013): first to 
            file. 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Removed the priority requirement.
                \item ``Prior user rights'' are granted to non-patentees who 
                were using the invention before someone else patented it, with 
                some limitations (e.g., non-transferability).
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Novelty: newness. \S\ 102(a).
            \item Statutory bars: timeliness. \S\ 102(b).
            \item Earlier use, even if not published, establishes prior art. 
            ``Public'' means ``not explicitly private.'' \emph{Rosaire}.
            \item Publication of a single copy in a foreign university library 
            can satisfy the publication limitation. \emph{Hall}.
            \item Hidden use (i.e., ``non-informing public use'') can still be 
            public use. \emph{Egbert}.
            \item Experimental use is not public use. \emph{City of 
            Elizabeth}.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Nonobviousness} (35 U.S.C. \S\ 103).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item ``Primary gatekeeper of the patent system.''
            \item No patent if the differences from prior art would have been 
            obvious to a PHOSITA.
            \item \S\ 103 requires an ``inventive leap.'' Minor obvious 
            improvements don't qualify. \emph{Graham}.
            \item The Federal Circuit's ``teaching, suggestion, or 
            motivation'' (TSM) test is too restrictive. The standard for 
            nonobviousness is flexible. Courts can use common sense. 
            \emph{KSR}.
            \item AIA: obviousness is determined at the \emph{filing date}, 
            not the invention date.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{PTO administrative procedures}.
    \item \textbf{Infringement}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Claim interpretation}: Courts can look to extrinsic 
        sources, like dictionaries, to discern the meaning of claim terms. 
        Patent construction is a matter of law, not fact (i.e., for judges, 
        not juries).  \emph{Phillips}.
        \item \textbf{Literal infringement}: patent owner must ``show the 
        presence of every element'' of the claim. \emph{Larami}.
        \item \textbf{Doctrine of equivalents}: patent owner must show the 
        ``substantial equivalent'' of every element of the claim. 
        \emph{Larami}.
        \item Test for infringement: ``Does the accused product or process 
        contain elements \textbf{identical or equivalent} to each claimed 
        element of the patented invention?'' The new test focuses on 
        individual elements, so it's known as the \textbf{``all elements 
        rule.''} \emph{Warner-Jenkinson}.
        \item \textbf{Prosecution history estoppel}: prevents patent holders 
        from claiming subject matter that they surrendered during prosecution. 
        It's a bar to an infringement claim, but the patentee can rebut it (1) 
        by showing that the infringing equivalent was unforeseeable at the 
        time of application, (2) the rationale for the amendment during 
        prosecution bears only a tangential relationship to the infringing 
        equivalent, or (3) some other reason. \emph{Festo}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Defenses} (35 U.S.C. 282).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Inequitable conduct}: To prove inequitable conduct, an 
        accused infringer must show (1) \textbf{materiality} (that the PTO 
        would have thought the omitted fact was important) and (2) 
        \textbf{intent} to deceive, by a clear and convincing evidence 
        standard. Inequitable conduct on one claim will render the entire 
        patent unenforceable. \emph{Therasense}.
        \item \textbf{Exhaustion}.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The first sale exhausts a patentee's control over future 
            sales and repairs (but not reconstructions).
            \item Downstream \emph{selling} is permitted, but \emph{copying} 
            is not. \emph{Bowman}.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Remedies} (35 U.S.C. \S\S\ 283--87).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Injunctions}: plaintiffs must satisfy a four-part test 
        to win a permanent injunction (irreparable injury, inadequacy of 
        monetary damages, balance of hardships between plaintiff and 
        defendant, and service of the public interest---see \emph{eBay}). 
        Kennedy, dissenting, would not allow injunctions for minor patents.
        \item \textbf{Damages}: (1) lost profits and (2) reasonable royalties.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Goal: find ``the difference between [patentee's] pecuniary 
            condition after the infringement, and what his condition would 
            have been if the infringement had not occurred.'' \emph{Yale 
            Lock}. Award the patentee's loss, not the infringer's gain.
            \item \emph{Panduit}: the patentee wants to show that would have 
            had sales that the infringer made. To do so, the patentee must 
            show the ``absence of acceptable noninfringing substitutes.''
            \item Reasonable royalty is a fallback when the patentee can't 
            show lost profits---the ``hypothetical bargain'' principle.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Willful infringement}: requires more than a showing of 
        negligence. \emph{Seagate}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Copyright}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Requirements}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Originality}: must have a modicum of creativity. Facts 
        are not copyrightable, but the ``selection, coordination, and 
        arrangement'' of facts can be. \emph{Feist}.
        \item \textbf{Fixation} in a tangible medium.
        \item \textbf{Formalities}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Notice}: encouraged but not required.
            \item \emph{Publication}: not required, but still relevant---see 
            p. 457.
            \item (See ``Analyzing Publication and Notice Problems'' below.)
            \item \emph{Registration}: has always been voluntary. Required to 
            bring an infringement suit.
            \item \emph{Deposit}: mandatory as part of registration, but 
            failure results only in a fine, not invalidity.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Subject matter}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Idea/expression dichotomy}: no protection for ``any 
        idea, procedure, process, system~.~.~.~.'' A useful idea cannot be 
        copyrighted, but an explanation of how to use it can be. \emph{Baker 
        v. Selden}.
        \item Computer menus are ``methods of operation'' (under 17 U.S.C. \S\ 
        102(b)) and therefore not copyrightable. \emph{Lotus v. Borland}.
        \item \textbf{Merger doctrine}: no protection for an expression if 
        it's the only feasible way to express an idea---e.g., mathematical 
        formulae.
        \item \textbf{Useful article doctrine}: spectrum from purely 
        functional design (e.g., industrial design---\emph{unprotectable}) to 
        pure expression (e.g., applied art, like a lamp 
        sculpture---\emph{protectable}). The only protected parts of a 
        ``picture, graphic, or sculpture'' work are the ``features that can be 
        identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently 
        of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.'' \S\ 101. No protection 
        if form and function are inextricable. \emph{Brandir}.
        \item \textbf{Government works}: not protected.
        \item \textbf{Types of protected works} (``illustrative, not 
        limitative''---\S\ 101):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Literary. Includes software.
            \item Pictorial, graphic, sculptural. See \emph{Brandir} and the 
            useful article doctrine above.
            \item Architectural. Applies to the overall design.
            \item Musical works and sound recordings. Musical works (sheet 
            music, lyrics, arrangements): fully protected. Sound recordings: 
            no traditional performance rights (although they now have a 
            digital performance right). For radio broadcasts, the owner of the 
            copyright of the \emph{composition} gets a royalty, but the 
            \emph{performer} does not.\footnote{Casebook p. 502.}
            \item Dramatic, pantomime, choreographic.
            \item Motion pictures and audiovisual works. Includes soundtracks.
            \item Semiconductors and vessel hulls: sui generis.
            \item Derivative works: owner of the original controls. 
            Compilations: must involve some degree of creativity.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ownership and duration}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Initial ownership rights}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Vests at the moment of creation.
            \item \textbf{Works for hire}: employer owns. \S\ 201(b). A 
            commissioned work is a work for hire if it falls into one of nine 
            enumerated categories (``work made for hire,'' \S\ 101). Courts 
            apply the common law agency rule. See \emph{CCNV v. Reid} and p. 
            512 top.
            \item \textbf{Joint work}: required (1) a copyrightable work, (2) 
            two or more authors, and (3) intent to merge contributions into an 
            inseparable or interdependent unitary whole. \emph{Aalmuhammed v.  
            Lee}.
            \item \textbf{Collective works}: copyright in a contribution is 
            distinct from copyright in the entire collection. \S\ 201(c).
            \item (See ``Analyzing IP Ownership Problems.'')
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Duration and renewal}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Duration}: life of the author plus 70 years.
            \item To determine duration for works published earlier, see the 
            chart on pp. 527--29.
            \item Renewal was required under the 1909 Act, but is \textbf{no 
            longer required}.
            \item Copyright law \textbf{restricts the alienability of 
            copyrights} in various ways.\footnote{Casebook p. 532.}
            \item \textbf{Division and transfer}:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item 1909 Act: copyright holders could not divide their 
                right. They could assign the whole thing, but any lesser 
                transfer was considered a license.
                \item 1976 Act: Eliminated restrictions on indivisibility. 
                Allows for exclusive licenses. Any holder of an exclusive 
                license can bring an infringement suit.\footnote{Casebook p.  
                533.}
            \end{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Renewal and termination of transfer}:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item 1909 Act: upon renewal, copyright holders could reclaim 
                copyright interests that they had licensed. (But most 
                licensees insisted on advance assignment.)
                \item 1976 Act: eliminated the renewal requirement. Copyright 
                holders could terminate transfers of copyright between the 
                thirty-fifth and fortieth year from the execution of the 
                transfer.  Congress wanted to give stronger rights to authors 
                and their families.  This violates freedom of contract, but it 
                compensates for publishers' ``unequal bargaining 
                power.''\footnote{Casebook p. 533.}
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rights of owners}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Reproduction}: proving infringement requires (1) copying 
        (proof of access, striking similarity) and (2) improper appropriation.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Circuits are split on whether you must show access. Second: 
            no need to prove access if there is enough similarity. Seventh: 
            you \emph{must} show evidence of access.
            \item \textbf{Levels of abstraction}: infringement is not limited 
            to the literal text. But there is a level of abstraction where a 
            work is no longer protected [because at that level it's an idea, 
            not an expression]. \emph{Nichols v. Universal}.
            \item Software: ``those elements of a computer program that are 
            necessarily incidental to its function are~.~.~.~unprotectable.'' 
            \emph{Computer Associates v. Altai}. Apply the 
            \textbf{abstraction, filtration, and comparison} test:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Abstract} the program into its structural parts.
                \item \textbf{Filter} out the merged ideas and public domain 
                parts.
                \item \textbf{Compare} the remaining protected pieces with the 
                structural parts of the allegedly infringing program.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Derivative works}: owner has the exclusive right. \S\ 
        106(2). Stock scenes and characters are not copyrightable, but 
        specific characters are. \emph{Anderson v. Stallone}.
        \item \textbf{Distribution}: owner has exclusive right---but the right 
        extends only to the \textbf{first sale}. \emph{Kirtsaeng v. Wiley}.
        \item \textbf{Public performance and display}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item 1972: no public performance rights for \emph{analog} sound 
            recordings. But there are performance rights for \emph{digital} 
            sound recordings (1995).
            \item \textbf{Public interest exemption} (\S\ 110): generally 
            applies to educational, free, or charitable performances and 
            displays.\footnote{Casebook p. 592.} Fairness in Music Licensing 
            Act (1998) broadened exemptions for homes, small business, 
            restaurants, and certain larger establishments.
            \item \textbf{Compulsory licenses}---five areas: cable, satellite, 
            jukeboxes, public broadcasting, webcasting.\footnote{Casebook p. 
            593--92.}
            \item \textbf{Moral rights}: applies only to visual works. 
            Resulted from Berne, 1990.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Indirect liability}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Indirect liability}: applies to those who 
        \textbf{contribute to, induce, or profit from} infringement, or those 
        who \textbf{sell products} that others can use to 
        infringe.\footnote{Casebook p. 598.}
        \item \textbf{Vicarious liability}: applies when someone exercises 
        direct control over another.
        \item \textbf{Substantial noninfringing uses} can insulate a 
        manufacturer from contributory liability. \emph{Sony v. Universal}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fair use}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Four factors (\S\ 107):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Purpose and character} (e.g., commercial/nonprofit).
            \item \textbf{Nature of the copyrighted work}.
            \item \textbf{Amount} and substantiality of the portion used.
            \item \textbf{Effect of the use upon the potential market} or 
            value of the original.
            \item (Detailed analysis of the four factors: see \emph{American 
            Geophysical Union v. Texaco}.)
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Overcoming fair use requires the copyright holder to show a 
        likelihood of harm. \emph{Sony v. Universal}.
        \item Critiques of \emph{Sony}'s ``substantial noninfringing use 
        standard:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If 85\% of uses are infringing and 15\% are infringing, 
            there is no liability. This is inefficient and costly.
            \item Menell and Nimmer: apply a ``reasonable alternative design'' 
            standard (from tort law). A different product design could 
            significantly reduce infringement at very little cost.
            \item Lanier: machines are shaping society instead of the other 
            way around.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Commercial uses are presumptively \emph{not} fair uses. The 
        effect on the market is a key factor. \emph{Harper \& Row v. Nation}.
        \item Wendy Gordon, fair use as market failure: fair use makes sense 
        when there are no opportunities for private agreements---unfavorable 
        reviews of a book.
        \item \textbf{Parodies} are fair use because they are transformative, 
        although courts should consider the effects on derivative markets. 
        \emph{Campbell v. Acuff-Rose}.
        \item \textbf{Remixes} can copy entire works if the use is 
        transformative. \emph{Bill Graham Archives v. DK}.
        \item \textbf{Reverse engineering}: ``We conclude that where 
        disassembly is the \textbf{only way to gain access to the ideas and 
        functional elements} embodied in a copyrighted computer program and 
        where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, 
        disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of 
        law.'' \emph{Sega v. Accolade}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Digital copyright law}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Anticircumvention} prohibits (1) circumventing or 
        enabling evasion of TPMs for \emph{access control} and (2) enabling 
        evasion of TPMs for \emph{copy control}. \S\S\ 1201(a), (b). 
        Circumventing authentication violates the DMCA. \emph{Realnetworks}.
        \item \textbf{Safe harbors}: OSPs must (1) have a termination policy 
        for repeat infringes, (2) must adopt ``standard technological 
        measures'' to screen copyrighted works, and (3) must identify a notice 
        and takedown agent. To be liable, the OSP must have \textbf{knowledge 
        or awareness of specific infringing activity}. \emph{Viacom v. 
        YouTube}.
        \item \textbf{Fair use}: Google Image search thumbnails are fair use. 
        A search engine ``transforms the image into a pointer, directing a 
        user to a source of information.'' \emph{Perfect 10 v. Amazon}.
        \item \textbf{Webcasting and compulsory licenses}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Current law: ``interactive services'' must negotiate 
            directly with copyright owners; non-interactive services have a 
            compulsory license.
            \item Lessig, Fisher: there should be an Internet-wide compulsory 
            license for downloading music. We should separate compensation 
            from control. See \emph{Free Culture}.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{International copyright law}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Lack of formalities has led to nearly worldwide protection for 
        most works.\footnote{Casebook p. 742.}
        \item BERNE, TRIPS.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Enforcement and remedies}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Injunctions}---four factors 
        (\emph{eBay}\footnote{Casebook p. 753.}):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Irreparable injury;
            \item The inadequacy of other remedies;
            \item Considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff 
            and defendant, an injunction is warranted; and
            \item ``~.~.~.~that the public interest would not be 
            disserved~.~.~.''
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Damages}: should be compensatory, not punitive.  
        \emph{Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn}.
        \item \textbf{Statutory damages}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Available to copyright holders who registered their 
            work.\footnote{Casebook p. 759.}
            \item Unintentional infringement: \$750 to \$30,000 (or \$200 as a 
            lower bound if the infringer had no reason to believe the activity 
            constituted infringement) per infringed work.
            \item Willful infringement: up to \$150,000 per infringed work.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Attorney fees}: courts have 
        discretion.\footnote{Casebook p. 761.}
