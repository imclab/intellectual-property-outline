\subsubsection{Novelty and Statutory Bars}

\paragraph{Novelty}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Old law (1952 Act): defines novelty from the \emph{date of first 
    invention}.
    \item New law (AIA, 2011): novelty is measured as of the \emph{date of the 
    patent application}.\footnote{Casebook p. 26.}
    \item \textbf{Novelty}: new compared to the prior art.
    \item \textbf{Statutory bar}: a bar based on too long a delay in seeking 
    patent protection.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{35 U.S.C. \S\ 102 (1952): Conditions for patentability; novelty and 
loss of right to patent}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (a) Novelty.
    \item (b) Statutory Bars.
    \item (c), (d): (omitted).
    \item (e) Secret Prior Art: Previously filed applications.
    \item (f) Derivation.
    \item (g) (inteference proceedings).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Novelty: \emph{Rosaire v. National Lead Co.}}
~\\\\Earlier use, even if not publicly known, establishes prior art.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1936: Rosaire and Horovitz patented a method for analyzing soil to 
    detect nearby oil.\footnote{Casebook p. 228.}
    \item National Lead argued that the patent was invalid and that there had 
    been no infringement.
    \item Rosaire admitted that Teplitz first invented the method, but argued 
    that Teplitz did not publish his ideas and that they were experimental.
    \item Held: Teplitz use was actual, not experimental, and that publication 
    was not required as long as Teplitz did the work openly.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\emph{Inherency Doctrine}}

% FIXME 232-234

\paragraph{Statutory Bars---Defining ``Publication'': \emph{In Re Hall}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hall applied for a chemical patent. The PTO rejected it because the 
    same process had been published in a German doctoral dissertation more than 
    a year earlier.\footnote{Casebook p. 234.}
    \item On appeal, the court held that publication in a university library was 
    ``sufficiently accessible, at least to the public interested in the art, so 
    that such a one by examining the reference could make the claimed invention 
    without further research or experimentation.''\footnote{Casebook p. 235.} 
    Affirmed.
\end{itemize}
