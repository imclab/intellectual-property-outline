\subsubsection{Novelty and Statutory Bars}

\paragraph{Novelty}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Old law (1952 Act): defines novelty from the \emph{date of first 
    invention}.
    \item New law (AIA, 2011): novelty is measured as of the \emph{date of the 
    patent application}.\footnote{Casebook p. 26.}
    \item \textbf{Novelty}: new compared to the prior art.
    \item \textbf{Statutory bar}: a bar based on too long a delay in seeking 
    patent protection.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{35 U.S.C. \S\ 102 (1952): Conditions for patentability; novelty and 
loss of right to patent}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (a) Novelty.
    \item (b) Statutory Bars.
    \item (c), (d): (omitted).
    \item (e) Secret Prior Art: Previously filed applications.
    \item (f) Derivation.
    \item (g) (inteference proceedings).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Novelty: \emph{Rosaire v. National Lead Co.}}
~\\\\
Earlier use, even if not publicly known, establishes prior art.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1936: Rosaire and Horovitz patented a method for analyzing soil to 
    detect nearby oil.\footnote{Casebook p. 228.}
    \item National Lead argued that the patent was invalid and that there had 
    been no infringement.
    \item Rosaire admitted that Teplitz first invented the method, but argued 
    that Teplitz did not publish his ideas and that they were experimental.
    \item Held: Teplitz use was actual, not experimental, and that publication 
    was not required as long as Teplitz did the work openly.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\emph{Inherency Doctrine}}

% FIXME 232-234

\paragraph{Statutory Bars---Defining ``Publication'': \emph{In Re Hall}}
~\\\\
Publication of a single copy in a foreign university library can satisfy 
the publication limitation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hall applied for a chemical patent. The PTO rejected it because the 
    same process had been published in a German doctoral dissertation more than 
    a year earlier.\footnote{Casebook p. 234.}
    \item On appeal, the court held that publication in a university library was 
    ``sufficiently accessible, at least to the public interested in the art, so 
    that such a one by examining the reference could make the claimed invention 
    without further research or experimentation.''\footnote{Casebook p. 235.} 
    Affirmed.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Statutory Bars---Public Use: \emph{Egbert v. Lippmann}}
~\\\\
Hidden use can be public use.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Barnes invented a new type of corset spring in 1855 but did not apply 
    for a patent until 1866. In the meantime, he had given at least two pairs to 
    Frances, who later became his wife and the assignee of the 
    patent.\footnote{Casebook pp. 237--39.}
    \item Frances sued for patent infringement. The question was whether the 
    invention had been in public use for more than two years\footnote{Now the 
    period is one year.} before the patent application.
    \item The Court (Justice Woods) held that it was a public use because (1) a 
    single use is enough, (2) giving the invention to one person is enough, and 
    (3) selling a hidden component of a public machine is still public use.
    \item Justice Miller, dissenting: if a hidden corset spring is a public use, 
    how can anything be a private use?\footnote{Casebook p. 240.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Experimental Use Exception: \emph{City of Elizabeth v. Pavement 
Company}}
~\\\\
Experimental use is not public use.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nicholson was issued a patent for wooden pavement in 1854. He had been 
    testing the design for the previous six years on a public street in 
    Boston.\footnote{Casebook pp. 243--44.}
    \item Nicholson sued the City of Elizabeth for infringement. Elizabeth 
    argued that the patent was invalid because the invention was in public use.
    \item The court held that experimental use is an exception to the public use 
    restriction. Here, Nicholson intended the use to be experimental, and the 
    public's use was only ``incidental.''\footnote{Casebook pp. 245--46.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Priority under the 1952 Act: 35 U.S.C. \S\ 102: Novelty and Loss of 
Right}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A person gets a patent unless:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (g)(1) during the course of an interference, another inventor (from 
        any WTO country) establishes that he got there first, or
        \item (g)(2) another U.S. inventor made the invention first.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item ``~.~.~.~priority generally goes to the first inventor to (1) reduce 
    an invention to practice, without (2) abandoning the 
    invention.''\footnote{Casebook p. 248.} An exception arises if the inventor 
    was not the first to reduce to practice but was reasonably diligent in doing 
    so.
    \item AIA sweeps away this complexity in favor of a first-to-file 
    system---see below. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Priority and the Reasonable Diligence Exception: \emph{Griffith v. 
Kanamaru}}
~\\\\
Delays to make an invention more marketable do not fall within the reasonable 
diligence exception.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Griffith and Kanamaru both invented the same compound.
    \item Timeline:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item June 30, 1981: Griffith established conception.
        \item November 17, 1982: Kanamaru filed for a patent.
        \item June 15, 1983 to September 13. 1983: Griffith was inactive.
        \item January 11, 1984: Griffith reduced to practice.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Griffith argued that he was reasonably diligent in reducing the 
    invention to practice while (1) he sought funding, as a form of peer review, 
    and (2) awaited the matriculation of a particular grad student, even though 
    there were other students who could have done the work.\footnote{Casebook p. 
    250.}
    \item The court held that the reasonable diligence exception applies to 
    ``everyday problems and limitations'' (e.g., illness), but held that delays 
    in order to ``refine an invention to the most marketable and profitable form 
    have not been accepted as sufficient excuses for 
    inactivity.''\footnote{Casebook p. 250--51.}
    \item Held (affirming the PTO): Griffith failed to establish a prime facie 
    case of reasonable diligence or a sufficient excuse for 
    inactivity.\footnote{Casebook p. 251.}
\end{enumerate}
